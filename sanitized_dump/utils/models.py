    In Django 1.10 the function get_all_field_names() was
    removed and can no longer be used. The Django documentation [1]
    suggests two replacement options of which this is the
    100% backwards compatible version. A simpler solution would be
    `[f.name for f in model._meta.get_fields()]`. But we try to keep
    backward compatibility as well as possible for now.
